I'm a Master's student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/) (KIT), studying mechatronics and information technology with a focus on `robotics` and `control engineering`.

> I truly believe that robots will change our modern world and therefore want to enable sophisticated, stable and safe `robot skills`. I am also interested in the `locomtion behavior` of robots, `learning complex dynamics`, `generative models` and `reinforcement learning`.

During my studies, I conducted research at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) (BCAI), focusing on learning contractive robot skills with obstacle avoidance using implicitly learned surface representations. Prior to that, I worked at the [Research Center for Information Technology](https://www.fzi.de/en/) (FZI), investigating locomotion behavior in a six-legged robot. During this period, I also co-founded the tech startup [Desoltik](https://desoltik.com/), aiming to enable automated semiconductor reconditioning. \
In addition, I applied my knowledge of control and system dynamics through voluntary work with the university group [mu-uero HYPERLOOP](https://www.mu-zero.de/). There, I was responsible for laying the groundwork in the non-linear levitation control and modeling the electromagnetic system.
