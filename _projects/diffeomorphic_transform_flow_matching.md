> :dart: **Goal**: Learn a contractive policy conditioned on the given scene

> :bulb: **Idea**: Transform a given base contractive dynamical system leveraging image embeddings and flow matching policies. Use the generated vectorfield as a diffeomorphism to map the base dynamics in to the target system beeing contractive towards the target trajectory.

To extract the image embeddings, DINOv2 with Registers is used. Given these embeddings a conditioned Unet backbone is trained using Flow Matching. The model architecture is analogous to [Diffusion Policy](https://github.com/real-stanford/diffusion_policy). Given this learned flow $$ùëâ_\text{FM}$$ defines a infinitesimal generator, which again defines a diffeomorphism $$\psi_\text{DT}$$ over a flow $$\gamma$$.

$$
\psi_\text{DT}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + \int ùëâ_\text{FM} (\gamma(\mathbf{x}, u))
$$

Given this diffeomorphic transform, I transform the base contractive dynamics $$f_\text{c}$$ into the target dynamical system $$f_\text{target}$$, as follows

$$
f_\text{target}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{J}_{\psi_\text{DT}}^{-1}(\mathbf{x})f_\text{c}(\psi_\text{DT}(\mathbf{x}))
$$

This approach is inspired by the paper [Euclideanizing Flows](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v120/rana20a.html).

:test_tube: **Experiments**: Move a T-Profile stable into an
U-Profile.

Just the picture of the scene is given. For training a spline trajectory between both profiles are calculated as groundtruth.
5000 scene and trajectory pairs a generated and sampled from a normal distribution. The final MSE on test dataset is $$0.297$$ and on traing dataset: $$0,023$$ (just the generated trajectories).
